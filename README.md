RecycleJungle
Unsure how to recycle? Need to know where is the nearest recycling point? RecyleJungle is here to help! It provides educational videos on how to recycle and shows where the closest recycling point is.

The inspiration behind our project is the issue that most people do not recycle due to 2 main reasons. Firstly, the lack of convenience. Despite there being centralised refuse chutes in most HDBs and condominums, residents would still prefer to throw small items like plastic bags in the chutes in their homes as it is more convenient. Secondly, the lack of knowledge on how to recycle. Research conducted by NEA figures show that over 50% of Singaporeans engage in frequent recycling practices but they do not have sufficient knowledge of what can be recycled or how to dispose of the recyclables properly. Hence, we were inspired to use the telebot to tackle such problems, by educating them on how to recycle properly, and provide locations on where to recycle when we are outside, so we can recycle conveniently as we travel from one destination to another.

Thus, we created a recycling bot that has two main functions. Firstly, it provides educational videos on how to recycle each material that the user has chosen. Secondly, it displays the nearest recycling point near the user's chosen location.
